It wraps up the cozy warm feeling you want plus a faint reminder of the holidays recently passed. The color is a deep Rich berry color like raspberries and blackberries mixed together. It‚Äôs a really nice scent that I think just about anyone would enjoy. I think it makes a great gift candle because the scent will appeal to everyone. It‚Äôs not overly strong but will definitely brighten your mood when you smell it. The color adds to any decor and with the berry scent I guess you really could burn this in the summer too when berries are growing and ripe to eat! I love a large glass jar style I think you get the best size and burn time for the money. I think the glass jar with sealing lid is a very safe candle to keep burning. I also love that you can see the color of the candle though the glass to enhance any room or home.",

It needs to be stronger. I also had the same thing happen when I ordered a candle called Tutti-Frutti.  I thought it would smell like candy but can‚Äôt hardly smell it at all, lite or not. I was disappointed in both candles. Have been a Yankee Candle fan for a very long time and haven‚Äôt had this problem before and that‚Äôs why I felt  comfortable ordering on line just from the fragrance description.

I start to light this in November to get us ready for putting our tree up and decorating for Christmas! The scent brings the outdoors, the Christmas Tree farm right in to my home! Fresh scent of a fresh cut tree with out cutting any trees down at all! It‚Äôs wonderful it‚Äôs bright it‚Äôs cheery yet cozy and warm and really brings you in to a forest of Christmas trees ! The candle color is beautiful! It captures the scent in the color and is really lovely to enhance any decor! The beautiful deep green color is definitely a favorite! I love the glass large jars I think very burn a really long time. I love the safety aspect of a the jar and the lid. I‚Äôm also a fan of being able to enjoy the color of the candle though the glass jar. Great quality great price",

It felt more appropriate given the woodsy feel. Boy oh boy, THIS CANDLE. I am normally a Balsam & Cedar girlie at Christmas, but I would convert fully to Log Cabin Flannel for Christmas and all of winter. Also probably my religion. I honestly would buy this by the pallet. IT'S THAT GOOD. And the plug-ins are just as good. It is definitely a complex candle and you need to appreciate the Eucalyptus/Patchouli/Musky vibes to really love this, because it is slightly masculine.
