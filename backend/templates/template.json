        "review_body": "This scent is a bit too florally for me. It\u2019s pleasant enough but I prefer a more fresh and clean scent or even more of a masculine scent. It has a nice scent throw without being over powering. I will probably use this every once in a while when I\u2019m looking to change things up. I wouldn\u2019t purchase this scent for myself a second time.",

Very soothing aroma. Reminds me of laying in a field of wild flowers. Lost in your thoughts. I need more. Love. Thanks!",
